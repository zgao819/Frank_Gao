"""
The code is written for COMPSCI235 Lab 2 Git. 

- You should work as a pair for this activity.
- Let the student who creates the repo be A, another student be B.

Tasks 1 -- Branching and merging
- Student A creates an empty public repo on GitHub (Do not include README nor 
copy right file).
- Student A commits this project to the repo.
- Student A creates a `requirement.txt` file and commit it.
- Student A adds Student B as a collaborator.
- Student B clones the repo to B's local machine.
- Student B finds a correct `.gitignore` file, and commit it.
- Both students create and checkout a new branch, A's branch is called "rand",
and B's branch is called "coin".
- Student A implements the `get_rand()` function.
- Student B implements the `toss_coin()` function.
- For both students, commit your code, and then merge to main.
- Resolve the conflict.
- Remove your temporary branch. 


Task 2 -- Forking and pulling request
- This time, B creates an empty repo and commit the starting code. 
- Student B commits the initial code to the repo.
- Student B creates a `requirement.txt` file and commit it.
- Student B adds Student A as a collaborator.
[New task starts here:]
- Student A forks the repo.
- Student A clones the forked repo to A's local machine. (The repo that under A's name.)
- Student A implements the `toss_coin()` function, and commits to the main branch. 
(Note: A and B are working on different repositories. A commits to A's forked main.)
- Student A send a pull request and merge the code.

You may delete your repo after all tasks have completed.


Questions:
1. In a scenario, where you work with others as a team. You wrote some code 
using the lab machine, but the code isn't working. You decide to continue 
working on the code from home. What's the best way to commit your unfinished code
to GitHub without interrupt others? What commands do you need to achieve that?

2. Explain the difference between merge and fork. Give an example for each use 
case.
